            What about children BMI?
        </h6>
        <p>
            For children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculator takes into account age and gender as well
            as height and
            weight.<br>

            Overweight children are thought to be at increased risk of a variety of health conditions, and they're
            also more likely to be overweight as adults.<br>
            <ul>
            The BMI calculator works out if a child or young person is::
            
            <li>
                underweight – on the 2nd centile or below
            </li>
            <li>
                 healthy weight – between the 2nd and 91st centiles
            </li>
            <li>
                overweight – 91st centile or above
            </li>
            <li>  
                very overweight – 98th centile or above
            </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
