    <p>
        To find out if you're a healthy weight for your height, work out your body mass index (BMI).You can easily check
        your BMI. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy.

                Are you worried about your BMI or waist size?
            </h6>
            <p>
                Measuring your waist is a good way to check you're not carrying too much fat around your stomach, which
                can raise your risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke.<br>

                You can have a healthy BMI and still have excess tummy fat, meaning you're still at risk of developing
                these conditions.<br>
                <ul>
                 Regardless of your height or BMI, you are at risk if your waist is:
                
                <li>
                94cm (37ins) or more for men
                </li>
                <li>
                80cm (31.5ins) or more for women
                </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                You're at very high risk and should contact a GP if your waist is:
                <li>
                102cm (40ins) or more for men
                </li>
                <li>  
                88cm (34ins) or more for women
                </li>
                </ul>

                What about children BMI?
            </h6>
            <p>
                For children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculator takes into account age and gender as well
                as height and
                weight.<br>

                Overweight children are thought to be at increased risk of a variety of health conditions, and they're
                also more likely to be overweight as adults.<br>
                <ul>
                The BMI calculator works out if a child or young person is::
                
                <li>
                    underweight – on the 2nd centile or below
                </li>
                <li>
                     healthy weight – between the 2nd and 91st centiles
                </li>
                <li>
                    overweight – 91st centile or above
                </li>
                <li>  
                    very overweight – 98th centile or above
                </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
